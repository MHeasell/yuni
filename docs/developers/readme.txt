Notes to developpers - General guidelines
=========================================

 - Keep your code clean and documented as much as possible, even (especially)
  in a work in progress
 - The public API must be the most simple as possible, with the less possible
  of parameters for usual functions
 - The public API must not depend on any external library
 - The public API must work on all supported platform. There might be
  ia few exceptions but there must be a very good reason for it.
 - Thinking low-level, writing high-level. 
   Keep in mind these important points :
   . The maintenance of the code
   . The Speed of execution of the code
   . The Simplicity of the code
   . The Portability
   . The Elegance and the high level of the code
