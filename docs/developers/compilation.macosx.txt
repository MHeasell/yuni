How to compile Yuni on Mac OS X
===============================


 A - Using Terminal
 ------------------

Prerequisites:
 - XCode
   Xcode Installation Basics :
   http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/Conceptual/XcodeCoexistence/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/Basics/Basics.html

 - MacPort : http://www.macports.org/
   (Installing MacPorts : http://www.macports.org/install.php)

 - CMake, via MacPort
   $ sudo port install cmake

 - The latest version of Subversion via MacPort (optional)
   $ sudo port install subversion

 - Make sure /opt/local/bin has been added to your environment path
   If you are not sure about this, type this before starting :
   $ export PATH="/opt/local/bin:$PATH"


1) Checkout the source code in any folder of your choice :
  $ svn co http://svn.shikami.org/yuni/trunk yuni

3) Generate the makefiles / projects:
  $ cd yuni/src
  $ cmake . -DMODULES=all

  Tips : You can run "cmake --help" for a list of generators for the -G option
         You can run "cmake -DMODULES=help" for a list of available Yuni modules

4) To compile, run make :
  $ make

  Tips : If you have more than one processor/core, you can run more than one job :
  $ make -j X
  where X is the number of jobs to run simultaneously.
