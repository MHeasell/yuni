
						OPENGL VERSUS DIRECTX

Preamble:
---------

This document is meant as a reference for similarities and differences
between DirectX and OpenGL. It can help design code that will work on
both frameworks and will allow us to recognize which parts absolutely
have to be framework-dependent. Also, it will be a support for abstraction
of concepts.

Mesh display:
-------------

Mesh display is very similar in both APIs, so we will be mainly interested
in where they diverge. The principal behind vertex buffers is to store the
vertices we want to display in a buffer, possibly stored in hardware.


						DirectX									OpenGL

Name they use:		Vertex Buffers							Vertex Buffer Objects (VBO)

Creation: 			HRESULT CreateVertexBuffer(
						UINT length,
						DWORD usage,
						DWORD FVF,
						D3DPOOL pool,
						IDirect3DVertexBuffer9** vBuf,
						HANDLE* handle);
