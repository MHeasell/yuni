DObject : Distributed Object, set of properties able to react to
	asynchronous messages.

Replica : Partial or complete read-only image of a DObject located
	on another node, automatically synchronized with its original
	DObject.

Node : Physical calculation unit, several nodes form a cluster.
	A node can be uniquely represented by an IP address, and a port
	number.

Node weight : Constraint determining the node's propension to host
	DObjects.

Topology : Repartition of K DObjects among N Nodes.


Problems at hand :
------------------
Problem 1 : How to balance a topology given a set of arbitrary constraints.
Problem 2 : How to synchronize the replicas with their reference DObject.
Problem 3 : How to detect node failures and what to do.
Problem 4 : How to promote a replica as the new DObject when a node fails.
Problem 5 : How to give weight to a node and update this weight.
Problem 6 : How to group DObjects and update group contents.
