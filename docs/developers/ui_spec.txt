Scope of this document :
========================

This document describes the User Interface (UI), both in functional terms
(what features it should include, what the behaviour should be) and
technical terms (how the code should be written, how the classes will
interact).



I) Definitions :
================

  User Interface
  ==============
UI is a specific term that describes the presentation, interaction and
behaviour of graphic controls (windows, buttons, panels, etc) that contain
one another, launch events when they change state, and can be seen and often
modified by the user directly.


  UI tree
  =======
A UI tree is an arborescent structure containing graphic controls, where each
node is a container for its children. In order for this tree to be displayed,
the root node must be a Desktop, and must be inserted in a context. A UI tree
may be inserted in several contexts at the same time.


  Desktop
  =======
A desktop is a component that can contain applications. It is typically the
root of a UI tree, but does not have to be.


  Context
  =======
A context defines how a UI tree will be displayed to screen. It is a combination
of a given window system (which is OS-dependent) and a graphics back-end
(OpenGL or Cairo under all platforms, DirectX under Windows). The context holds
internal representations of the UI windows as implemented in this given context.


II) Use cases :
===============
TODO


III) Class hierarchy :
======================

UI::IComponent
|
 -> UI::IControl
|   |
|    -> UI::Context3D::IContext3D
|   |    |
|   |     -> UI::Context3D::OpenGL
|   |    |
|   |     -> UI::Context3D::DirectX
|   |
|    -> UI::Button
|
 -> UI::IControl, UI::ControlWithItems
    |
     -> UI::Window
    |
     -> UI::IPanel
         |
          -> UI::Panel
