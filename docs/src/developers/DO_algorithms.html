	<h1>Glossary</h1>
	<ul>
	  <li>DObject : Distributed Object, set of properties able to react to
		asynchronous messages.</li>
	  <li>Replica : Partial or complete read-only image of a DObject located
		on another node, automatically synchronized with its original DObject.</li>
	  <li>Node : Physical calculation unit, several nodes form a cluster.
		A node can be uniquely represented by an IP address, and a port
		number.</li>
	  <li>Node weight : Constraint determining the node's propension to host
		DObjects.</li>
	  <li>Topology : Repartition of K DObjects among N Nodes.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Problems at hand</h1>
	<ul>
	  <li>Problem 1 : How to balance a topology given a set of arbitrary constraints.</li>
	  <li>Problem 2 : How to synchronize the replicas with their reference DObject.</li>
	  <li>Problem 3 : How to detect node failures and what to do.</li>
	  <li>Problem 4 : How to promote a replica as the new DObject when a node fails.</li>
	  <li>Problem 5 : How to give weight to a node and update this weight.</li>
	  <li>Problem 6 : How to group DObjects and update group contents.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Key programming concepts</h1>
	<ul>
	  <li>Identity : what is this DObject, and how to identify it uniquely</li>
	  <li>Replicas : how many, where and how to reach them</li>
	  <li>Behavior : what messages the replicas can send and receive to other DObjects</li>
	  <li>State : actual data, either fully in one place or as the sum of data in the replicas</li>
	  <li>Interfaces (endpoints) : how to interact locally with a replica (events, UI, ...)</li>
	  <li>Reference : a reference to a DObject contains all the info required to build a replica of it</li>
	  <li>Types : Object typing determines the interfaces, state and behavior of the DObject</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Question 1</h1>
	<p>
	  We have been discussing a paradigm where every DObject always has an existing physical
	  representation on one node. This representation would be the original and the replicas
	  would be either full or partial copies. It is called <it>primary-backup</it> scheme
	  (<it>master-slave</it> scheme).
	</p>

	<table border="none">
	  <tr><td>[DObject1]</td><td>&rarr;</td><td>[OriginalFull]</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>&rarr;</td><td>[Replica1Partial]</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>&rarr;</td><td>[Replica2Full]</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>&rarr;</td><td>[Replica3Partial]</td></tr>
	</table>

	<p>
	  However, another paradigm would be to make sure that all the data in a DObject exists
	  physically among all the replicas, meaning there would not be a single master original.
	  It is called <it>multi-primary</it> scheme (<it>multi-master</it> scheme).
	</p>

	<table border="none">
	  <tr><td>[DObject1]</td><td>&rarr;</td><td>[Replica1Partial]</td></tr>
	  <tr><td></td><td>&rarr;</td><td>[Replica2Partial]</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>&rarr;</td><td>[Replica3Partial]</td></tr>
	</table>
	<p>
	  (supposing the 3 replicas together contain all the data for the DObject)
	</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Is this second paradigm acceptable in terms of node failure recovery ?</li>
	  <li>Is it acceptable in terms of data syncing ?</li>
	</ul>
