<h1>Understanding how Yuni works</h1>
<p>
This section will deal with some important concepts in Yuni. Some may already
be familiar to you, and others may be new. These concepts were not invented
by the Yuni team, but they are fundamental to the understanding of how Yuni
works, and therefore to the proper use of Yuni.
