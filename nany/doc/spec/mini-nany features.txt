<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Mini-Nany is a subset of Nany, in terms of grammar and features. Its goal
is to offer a more manageable language for compiler bootstrapping.
The purpose of this document is to describe what parts of Nany must be
implemented in a compiler for it to support Mini-Nany. Since most of this
document will be expressed in terms of differences to the full Nany language,
knowledge of the Nany language specification is required for full
understanding.
</p>


<h2>Typing</h2>

<p>
Mini-Nany is not type-inferred, therefore types may not be omitted. All
typing must be provided when declaring functions, methods, attributes and
variables. A compliant implementation _should_ detect type errors but it
is not a requirement, the most important point being the ability to generate
a valid binary from valid Mini-Nany code.
</p>


<h2>Workflows</h2>

<p>
Mini-Nany does not support Workflows. As a rather high-level feature that
impacts overall code flow and generates a lot of instructinos from very few
lines of Nany, it was deemed too bulky for Mini-Nany.
</p>


<h2>`where` overloads</h2>

<p>
Mini-Nany does not support `where` overloads.
A compliant Nany compiler should be able to discriminate,
depending on the way functions are invoked, whether the result is constant and
should be calculated statically, or whether the calculation is to be made
at run time. This is a complicated feature, that requires deep static analysis.
Also, `where` clauses imply to manipulate overloads, to check for sanity between
conditions and sometimes to inject code directly in the function.
</p>


<h2>`in` and `out` blocks</h2>

<p>
Mini-Nany does not support `in` and `out` blocks, mostly for the same reasons
as the `where` overloads : complicated static analysis and a lot of code to
inject in the functions.
</p>


<h2>Constrained sets</h2>

<p>
Nany offers lists by comprehension, which are defined using constraints on a
set, and the `|` operator. This is another very complicated feature that
Mini-Nany does not support.
</p>


<h2>Threading</h2>

<p>
Mini-Nany offers no multi-threading support.
</p>


<h2>Distributed objects</h2>

<p>
Mini-Nany does not allow DObjects. Shared new operator is invalid.
</p>


<h2>Transactional memory</h2>

<p>
Mini-Nany is not transactional. Memory management mimics the
copy-on-write behaviour using refcounting smart pointers, and has
limited garbage collection capabilities.
