	** A condition variable is a synchronization object used in conjunction with a
	** mutex. It is a synchronization mechanism that allows a thread to suspend its
	** execution until the Condition is signalled by another thread.
	**
	** This can be used in many ways, from interruptible sleep to signal handlers,
	** but also as a thread startup synchronization mechanism.
	**
