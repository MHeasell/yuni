About the Yuni project
======================

The Yuni project is a high-level cross-platform framework. This framework
intends to provide the most complete set of coherent API as possible
related to 3D programming, especially game programming. It intends to be a
reliable and simple bridge between different worlds to make all sorts of
applications, letting the user focus on its real work.
The Yuni project is connected with all those domains :
 - 3D graphics
 - Physics
 - 2D/3D User Interface in 3D context
 - 2D/3D Input devices
 - Sound, playback of 2D/3D sounds
 - Scripting languages
 - Artificial Intelligence, mainly on 3D objects
 - Threading / Parallel computing
 - Networking
 - Real-time and multi-user Collaboration
 - Any other domain related to multimedia or user interaction.




What the Yuni project is not :
------------------------------

 - It is not a 3D engine. Yuni only provides a common wrapper to external 3D
  engines (such as Irrlicht or Ogre for example).
 - It is not a physics engine. Yuni only provides a common wrapper to external
  physics engines (such as ODE for example)
 - It is not a sound engine. Yuni only provides a common wrapper to external
  sound engines (such as FMod for example)
 - It is not a language, neither a scripting language
 - It does not provide any program. It is a set of libraries only.
